# TipTac Reborn
WoW AddOn TipTac Reborn [DF] [WotLKC] [Classic Era]

TipTac Reborn is a tooltip enchancement addon, it allows you to configure various aspects of the tooltip, such as moving where it's shown, the font, the scale of tips, plus a lot more. It's the successor of the original [TipTac by Aezay](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tip-tac) (abandoned since Nov 2020) with massive modifications since then.

### The following problems aren't fixed

- Padding for embedded tooltips and battle pet (ability) tooltips doesn't work. However, this only becomes a problem if a particularly thick border is set.

If there are additional fixes in the future, I update this note accordingly.

After using many WoW addons in the last years I decided to give something back to the mod/addon community and continued the one or other not longer supported/maintained projects (see [here](https://www.curseforge.com/members/frozn45/projects)) including TipTac.

## Common issues

#### Error message: `Font not set`
**Solution:** Make sure both the `Font->Font Face`, as well as the `Bars->Font Face` are properly set to a valid font.

#### Error message: `Action[SetPoint] failed because[SetPoint would result in anchor family connection]: attempted from: GameTooltip:SetPoint`
**Solution:** Delete file `World of Warcraft\__<Edition>__\WTF\<Account>\<Server>\<Character>\layout-local.txt`
