TipTacTalents - Show Player Talents in Tooltips
-----------------------------------------------
Using this addon, you will see the talent specialization of players added to the tooltip.

A cache up to 25 is stored for the last scanned players, so you quickly can see their talents again without having to wait for talents to load.

To avoid inspect issues, TipTacTalents will not request talents if you have an inspect frame open.
That includes the default inspect frame, as well as the addon Examiner.

There is no command line switch or configurable options for TipTacTalents when used alone.
Using TipTac and TipTacOptions however, you can change the cache size and the option to turn it on or off.

This addon is also included as part of the TipTac package, but is released here on it's own, for those who do not need special tip customisations.
